# Gif Tastic

Deployment link: https://markus902.github.io/UNH-07-GifTastic/

### Scope

This project uses a Materialize front-end and the Giphy API and local storage to create a simple application. The user is provided with 5 initial category buttons. These can be clicked and a selection of 10 Gifs including rating will be displayed.
By checking the checkbox the user can decide if the previous Gifs should be kept and more Gifs be added. By searching for a new category the user can add new buttons by clicking the add button or hitting the Enter key.
When a Gif is clicked the image changes from static to active Gif and gets added to the favourite section on the top. New users will not have a favourite until they click an image. The app will remember which Gif was clicked last and declared as a favourite and will display it in the favourite section.
